# Deep Learning Leader

## About
This repository contains code for the project my ongoing project exploring the usefulness of modern, `deep', neural networks for forecasting political instability. I still need to do more work related to interpretability (e.g. variable importance and partial dependence plots) and explore different hyper parameter settings for networks more than 1 hidden layer.
